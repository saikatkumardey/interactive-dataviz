# What is it?

It's an interactive application written using Dash (a.k.a shiny for python). This application demonstrates how easily you can build interactive visualizations in pure Python. I have used the classic iris dataset in this project.

**No HTML/CSS/JS required.** Although you could choose to add CSS and write your custom React/JS components.
